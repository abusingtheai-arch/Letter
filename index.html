When you asked kinsa akong ginapadungan about sa akong notes, sa tinuod ra ikaw dyud to.

This might come as a surprise, but I like you. Kabalo ko nga wala ka ga-tuo ug mga words, as you once said, but I hope you’ll read this with an open heart. You might not have noticed, but I’ve admired you for quite some time.

Please know that you are both beautiful and intelligent. You often underestimate yourself by comparing to others, but you shouldn’t because you shine differently.

I really like the way you smile; it’s so genuine and warm that it makes my worries fade away. (Ga-awkward smile guro ka ron) I admire your thoughtfulness, how you care for your family and to those who are close to you, how you never forget their birthdays, and how much effort you put into making them happy. You’re independent and responsible, facing your problems quietly even when things get difficult. Girl, get some sleep. I also find you cute kanang mangluod ka.

And by the way, you look beautiful both with your hair down and with your bun hairstyle. (you always do)

I know you already have someone special, someone you truly like. I don’t expect you to feel the same way, and I respect that completely. Please don’t feel pity; that’s not what I want.

I just wanted you to know how I truly feel. And after this, I hope we can still continue our days just like before. Pls lang, basig mag-lahi na imong tan-aw sa akoa, best believe it’s still the old me.
      </p>
