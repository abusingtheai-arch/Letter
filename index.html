<h1>To The One Whom I Admire,</h1>
<p>
When you asked kinsa akong ginapadungan about sa akong notes, sa tinuod ra ikaw dyud to, it was always you.


I want to be honest with you, and this might come as a surprise to you. I have always liked you, and I hope you read this with an open heart. Ana ka wala ka ga tuo ug mga words kay para sa imoha atik ra, pero tinuod dyud ni.


I developed feelings for you, more than just a friend (hehe sorry). I have always admired your beauty and intelligence. You tend to underestimate yourself by comparing to others, but you shouldn't, because you shine differently.


I like your smile, those that shine brightly with full length (full length yarn). It’s so genuine and warm that it makes my worries fade away. Kanang bad trip gud adlaw tas bigla raka mu smile, na wala na, maka smile pud tag pinakalit hahay. I admire your thoughtfulness, how you care for those people close to you. Even though they make you mad sometimes, you still care for them. Tapos nag paplano kapang mag bigay ng mga bday gifts sa mga kaibigan mo grabehh, how much effort you make them happy. You are such a giver girl. Minsan napapaisip ako, inuuna mo ba sarili mo teh? You are so independent and responsible, facing your problems silently (kombati engineering). And these days, I seem to notice that you now ask for help which is very nice. Sabi ko nga, kung may gusto kang patulong, sabihin mo lang. Napaka independent mo kasi, patulong ka naman. Tas ganahan pud ko mang luod ka haha la lang cute, hehe sorry gina asar tika.


I really appreciate your beauty, kanang imong mga magagandang soutin grabe talaga, pati pud kanang imong buhok gwapa kaayo ka (always man) na minsan gusto nako suklayon imong buhok gamit kamot ra. “Caress” ata to.


And I also know you already have someone special, someone you truly like. I don’t expect you to feel the same way, and I respect that completely. Please don’t feel pity for me, it’s not what I want. Like fr fr, not what I want.


It took courage to write this. I just want you to know how I truly feel, and I hope that after you read this we can still continue our days like before. Dyud please lang basig di nako nimo pansinon tas biglaang lalayo ka na (huhuhu), lahi na imong tanaw sa akoa. Best believe it’s still the old me, same ra before.
